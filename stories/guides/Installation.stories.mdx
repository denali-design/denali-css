# Installation
Learn how to install Denali CSS into any web project.

Denali is a CSS library. This means it provides CSS classes to help you style your HTML code.
To use Denali, you can either use the pre-compiled `.css` file or install the `.sass` files so you can customize it to your needs.

---

## Using Denali via CDN
To get started quickly just import a two `.css` files from [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) for components and icons. Please note that many features we descriibe in our documentation such as themeing. These will not be available without incorporating Denali into tour build process.

### Denali
This CDN link includes everything you see documented in Denali CSS components, layouts, resets, and helpers. Please note this CDN link does not include the [Denali Icon Font](https://github.com/denali-design/denali-icon-font) library.
```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/denali-css/css/denali.css
```

### Icons
This CDN link can be used to import out Icon Font library. You just have to inlcude one `.css` file.
```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/denali-icon-font/dist/denali-icon-font.css
```

## Using Denali via SCSS
For most projects we recommend installing Denali via package managers which will expose the `.scss` files. These give you the flexibility of building your application the way you see fit and utilize all Denali has to offer.

If you've never heard of SASS or wondering how its different then other preprocessor, you can learn a little more on the [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) website.

### Install Denali via npm
For most projects and to take advantage of our themeable features, you'll want to install Denali via npm.
```
npm install denali-css
```

### Compile SCSS
You'll need to incorporate SCSS into your developement and build process. There are a few ways to do this, but we'll be going over the CLI commands provided by [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass).
```
sass <path-to-denali.scss> [output-file.css]
```

After compiling the SCSS to your output file you can pull it into your HTML like any other stylesheet.
```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <!-- ... -->
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <link href="output-file.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
  <!-- ... -->
</body>
</html>
```

### Import SCSS into a custom CSS file
If you'd like to process custom SCSS with Denali's default styles, create a SCSS file wherever you normally would and use the `@use` rule to load Denali into your file.
```css
@use 'path-to-denali.scss'

/* Custom SCSS */
$color-var: #303030;

.bg-color {
  background: $color-var;
}
```

This is the same way you can create themes within one file. If you want to learn more about creating themes take a look at our [theme documentation](/?path=/story/get-started-theming--page).

## Code Requirements
For Denali components and icons to work correctly and as expected, you'll want to use HTML5 doctype and include responsive viewport meta tags to properly scale your styles accross all devices.

### Use the HTML5 Doctype
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

### Add the responsive viewport meta tag
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

## HTML Starter Template
If you want to get started right away, you can use this HTML starter template. That contains all the code requirements and includes Denali components and icons via CDN.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <!-- Denali CSS & Icons -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/denali-icon-font/dist/denali-icon-font.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/denali-css/css/denali.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <p>My first website with <strong>Denali</strong>!</p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```
